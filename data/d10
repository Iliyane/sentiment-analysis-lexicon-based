Appalling customer service

I am appalled at the lack of care and customer service
Over rated and over priced
After calling 7 months in advance for afternoon tea I was told to call back to book on a specific date. Which I waited to do. Then I called and it was fully booked. It was for a 60th birthday surprise. Claridges have the wrong date to call. After waiting months to book. Now everywhere else booked too.
Just appalling

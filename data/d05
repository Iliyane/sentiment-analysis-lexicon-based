I live locally in Greenwich and this is the second time we got takeaway from this shop. First time I had chips and sausage, nothing special standard chippy food. An hour later I had stomach ache but nothing like what I have experienced since yesterday
Yesterday, we went for takeaway with my fiance we ordered chicken pie, beef pie chips and mushy peas and I am in agony all night and all day today.
I had terrible food poisoning and my stomach is killing me
My partner is also not feeling well
NEVER AGAIN
I am now going to find another local chip shop

A great new steak restaurant in Clapham

This friendly and busy restaurant is a welcome addition to the Clapham dining scene. There's a great range of steaks all cooked just right. Nibbles include baby Yorkshire puddings and proper gravy. The chips cooked in beef dripping are sublime. Staff are really friendly and our party of 10 people were really well looked after. The bill was very reasonable too - I'll definitely go back.

Expectations not met.

I went twice in two weeks, the first time I thought the person in charge, he seemed to be anyway, was not on the ball, not smiling, not really happy to be there.
First impressions, not so good.
We ordered afternoon tea or teas and cakes but I had to call for the order to be taken, Now this hotel prides itself in serving people from the middle east, they should know they do not like to wait and it was long, hot drinks served promptly but not the food on both occasions.
Fortunately I grabbed a waitress, Suisse and she was much more switched on , she really seemed to care, she definitely made me want to return again.
As for the food, it was good but the cakes are way too big, they are usually shared and it is not easy, more cakes but in small size would be great.
I would still recommend the Mandarin, the room is gorgeous and the atmosphere is nice.

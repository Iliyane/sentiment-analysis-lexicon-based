Too busy- no sushi for you

Tried to get takeout several times now. More than half the time they reply that they are too busy and don’t have time/ Interest to make sushi. Most of the time this even happens when restaurant is half empty.

Unfortunately not a reliable place for food, they will lose customers such as myself that won’t go back as it is a crapshoot if they will have time to serve you. We would like to support local restaurants but this one is too unreliable.

Sushi- when available, is pretty decent, the platters are nice to share.

Nice but not great.

We had a lovely catch up with my friend last night. We were seated outside,upon my request. Little that I new that it was smoking allowed area. Myself, as a smoker, it made no difference, but my friend did not enjoy his time thurely as per other people smoking around us. Heads up to the families with children or non smokers- ask to be seated inside .
Food was nice.
Arancini cooked to perfection.
Trout fishcakes, bit soggy, bland, cooked from frozen and under done.
Salmon beautify cooked, but masterstock should have been a bit more reduced.
Club sandwich would be better of if it would be deconstructed.
Bread a bit stale for the price of 3.50Â£ , but what a hay.
Service was a bit odd.
I was served by Jade. Lovely girl. But table service was so impersonal and cold. It goes to other member of staff as well. Almost as if they didn't what to be there. However when I saw them at their waiters station's or bar area, they looked so energetic and full of lafter , while dancing around and beein joyfull.
Food for thought?--- Be the same around your guests. And then you will have more returning guests and more cash tips.
Cocktails are amazing.
Sticky toffee pudding is ridiculously good.

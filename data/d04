Happy hours not respected

Spent our evening there but will probably be the last time we go there even though we live nearby. We arrived specifically before the end of the happy hours and the waiter said it was still valid. 4 hours later when the bill arrived after our dinner there was no sign of happy hours... Waitress was rude and did not smile all evening, no wonder we were almost the only ones inside. Food was ok but overpriced for what it is

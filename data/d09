Afternoon Tea

Birthday afternoon tea to treat my Fiancée. Very Christmassy which made for a great atmosphere and wintery feel. We had the festive afternoon tea which came with Christmas pudding and a glass of champagne. The sandwiches were spot on with a good selection, most notably the truffled egg. Delectable scones. Great selection of cakes. We particularly liked the white chocolate and pear cake. We found the descriptive menu of all the teas, sandwiches and cakes very useful, especially when selecting teas. One slight negative is that my Fiancée had mint tea and felt that it wasn't topped up with hot water frequently enough and that a separate pot of hot water would have been useful. All in all as afternoon tea enthusiasts and having visited a lot of the top competitors in London, this was arguably our best afternoon Tea to date.

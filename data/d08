Underwhelming

Unfortunately, given the hype around Claridge's afternoon team, I found the experience rather underwhelming.

The foyer is beautiful and the welcome was warm and hospitable. Both of the waiters attending us were lovely. The sandwiches were tasty but the scones were rather dry and the cakes were too sweet for my taste. Unfortunately, I also found lipstick on my napkin as well as two pieces of hair in the milk! Not the type of incident you want involved in any culinary activity let alone one that is not exactly cheap.

I don't think anything tops up the Ritz experience and I probably won't return.
